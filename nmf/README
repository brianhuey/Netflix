Feature: NMF
This is the code we used to compute our NMF features. It is quite slow, and probably best to run on  an EC2 instance. 

To get nmf features on validation setA.a (or setA.b,setB.a,setB.b):

Run the function final_nmf_prediction() in python with the following inputs

inputs: filename = 'pre_2005.training' (available at C3/stat157-uq85def/shared/netflix/training2/pre_2005.training)
   	test_filename = 'setA.a', (avaiable at C3/stat157-uq85def/shared/netflix/feature_sample/setA.a
	dir_prefix ='./setA.a.nmf.validation'

	
To get nmf features on test set 2006:

inputs:
	filename ='training_set.txt' (available at C3/stat157-uq85def/shared/netflix/training2/training_set.txt)
	test_filename = 'who_rated_what_2006.txt' (available at C3/stat157-uq85def/shared/netflix/test_sets/who_rated_what_2006.txt')
	dir_prefix = './who_rated_what_2006.nmf.test'


Graphs:
To run do.nmf.graphs.R which show distribution of features on ratings and non-ratings of validation setA to 
assess feature utility:

In R run source("do.nmf.graphs.R") after moving the files setA.a.nmf.validation.scaled and 
setA.b.nmf.test.validation.scaled to this directory from s3/stat157-uq85def/home/reneerao/Data 
for Netflix project.
